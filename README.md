# Red Blood Cell Molecular Dynamics
A Molecular Dynamics Analysis Software for Red Blood Cells Based on Lammps

- **preprocessor**: A cross platform client program built by Tauri + Vite + Vue3 + NaiveUI, used as a UI and communicating with the solver(lammps).
- **solver**: [Lammps](https://lammps.org/), used to study molecular dynamics.
- **post processor**: vmd, 3D model used to demonstrate lammps generation.
